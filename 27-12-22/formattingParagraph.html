    Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the <a href="">
        Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML
    specification, the <em> <ins> "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)"</ins></em> Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and <a
        href=""> Dan
        Connolly</a>, which included
    an SGML <a href=""> <abbr title="Document type Definition"> Document type definition</abbr></a> to define the
    grammar. <a href=""><sup>[9][10]</sup></a> The draft expired after six months,
    but was notable
    for its acknowledgment of the <code> NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag</code> for embedding in-line images,
    reflecting the IETF's
    philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft,
    <strong> "HTML+
        (Hypertext Markup Format)",</strong> from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like
    tables and
    fill-out forms. <a href=""><sup> [11]</sup></a>
