    <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> elements are the building blocks of HTML Pages.With HTML constructs, images
    and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.HTML provides a meansx to create
    structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as <strong><em> headings,
            paragraphs,lists,links,
            quotes and other items.</em></strong> HTML elements are delineated by tags,written using <ins> angel
        brackets.</ins>Tags such as &lt;img/&gt; and &lt;input/&gt; directly introduce content into the page.Other
    tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide
    information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.Browser do not display the HTML tags but
    use them to interpret the content of the page.
